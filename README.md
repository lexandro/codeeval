CodeEval
========


!!! I strongly recommend to do your own solutions first, then you can compare with mine (all feedbacks are welcome) !!!

My solutions for CodeEval challenges are mainly written in Java. I'm trying to minimize the memory and CPU usage, but sacrificing the readability intentionally if necessary.
